Description: Reads files exported from 'QX Manager or QuantaSoft' containing 
    amplitude values from a run of ddPCR (96 well plate) and robustly sets 
    thresholds to determine positive droplets for each channel of each 
    individual well. 
    Concentration and normalized concentration in addition to other metrics is 
    then calculated for each well. Results are returned as a table, optionally 
    written to file, as well as optional plots (scatterplot and histogram) for 
    both channels per well written to file. The package includes a shiny 
    application which provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to the
    full functionality of PoDCall.
